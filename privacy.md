# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on NsikaFinance's apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

NsikaFinance accounts are created using own username and passwords. Email addresses are only used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, and sending notifications that you request. We donâ€™t send promotional emails.
We store information about your transactions in a encrypted database.

## Technical basics

If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.
If you capture transactions, we need to store them in an encrypted cloud database. We use session token to associate user with a session. Our server software does not store basic technical information, such as your IP address.

## Ads and analytics

NsikaFinance app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
No personal data is used to target NsikaFinance's ad.

## Information usage

We do not use the information for any external purpose. We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish NsikaFinance's functionality. 
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently bcrypt).

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

NsikaFinance may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

## Your Consent
